### Steps to Follow:
1. Please assemble the Robot as instructed by Instructor.
2. Please follow the same Steps from Step 8 to Step 18 of Project 7- Line Follower 
Robot.
3. Please follow the same Steps from Step 11 to Step 16 of Project 5- Android 
Smartphone Based Device Control.
4. Connect a Jumper Wire between G29 to +ve (5V) Common Terminal on Breadboard.
5. Open the Sketch for Voice-Controlled-Robot Program.
6. Connect the USB cable with Arduino & Computer.
7. Click on Upload Option to download the program in Arduino. Note: While 
downloading the program please disconnect the Rx & Tx Jumper wire from Arduino 
Board. Once you finish with the download then re connect the Rx & Tx Jumper Wire.
8. Disconnect USB cable from Arduino & Connect 9V DC Battery to Arduino by using 
battery connector.
9. Run the AMR_Voice App in your Android Smartphone.
10. App will ask you to enable the Bluetooth. Allow It.
11. Search for your Bluetooth Device HC-05-(Group No). Once Connected Red Led on 
Bluetooth module will blink once per second instead of fast blinking.
