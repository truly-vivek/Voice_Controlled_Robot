### Components Required:
  - Arduino UNO Board
  - Arduino USB Cable
  - Breadboard
  - HC-05 Bluetooth Module
  - L293D Motor Driver Module
  - Resistors:1K (Brown, Black, Red) & 2.2K Ohm (Red, Red, Red)
  - Robotics Kit Part: Robo Chasis, 2 DC Motor, Clamps, Screw Sets, Screw Driver, Nut 
    Driver, 2 Wheels.
  - Jumper Wires M-M & M-F.
### Steps to Follow:
1. Connect a Jumper Wire between G29 to +ve (5V) Common Terminal on Breadboard.
2. Open the Sketch for Voice-Controlled-Robot Program.
3. Connect the USB cable with Arduino & Computer.
4. Click on Upload Option to download the program in Arduino. Note: While downloading the program please disconnect the Rx & Tx Jumper wire from Arduino Board. Once you finish with the download then re connect the Rx & Tx Jumper Wire.
5. Disconnect USB cable from Arduino & Connect 9V DC Battery to Arduino by using battery connector.
6. Run the AMR_Voice App in your Android Smartphone.
7. App will ask you to enable the Bluetooth. Allow It.
8. Search for your Bluetooth Device HC-05-(Group No). Once Connected Red Led on Bluetooth module will blink once per second instead of fast blinking.
9. Then control the devices from your Voice Commands on AMR_Voice App.
10. Voice Commands to be used: forward, backward, left, right, stop.
